# BasicAppUsingAllAngularFeatures

I am learning angular so i thaught why not make a repo for it.
So if i forget anything in future it may act as a reference guide for me.

I am going to use all the features of angular. So there will be two versions
of the basic student protal, which can be deferenciated between angular versions.
So one will be based on angular 1.5.x and another will be on angular 2.x.
