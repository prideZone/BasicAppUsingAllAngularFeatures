# BasicAppUsingAllAngularFeatures

I am learning angular so i thaught why not make a repo for it.
So if i forget anything in future it may act as a reference guide for me.

I am going to use all the features of angular. So there will be two versions
of the basic student protal, which can be deferenciated between angular versions.
So one will be based on angular 1.5.x and another will be on angular 2.x.

The problem this project tries to solve other then learning angular
====================================================================
1.) It will start with a admin signin or registration page.

2.) When he/she logged in it shows a header on the top with user info button on the side.

3.) On the right side of the app there is a button to nevigate to different links.

4.) Links contains :

    a.) product registration page.
    
    b.) view all products.
    
    c.) User accounts.
    
    d.) consumption and profit and loss report page.
    
    e.) Goal setting page.
    
    f.) Feedback page.
    
5.) View all products page consistes of the product tiles which consistes of,

    a.) basic info of product.
    
    b.) product image.
    
    c.) product price.
    
    d.) add to cart button.
    
6.) Cart contains the product info and price info. But no payment module will be included in the project.

    Because it is considured to be a dummy project so it may not be as feature rich as possible.
    
7.) The home page containse search bar which search between all the products.

8.) A filter may be implemented in the future but not sure for now.


**Note: These are just a rough estimation of the whole program and it may change as the implementation go on.**
